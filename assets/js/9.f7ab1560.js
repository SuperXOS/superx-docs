The GNU utilities plus the software packages available are enough to be used for any task. SuperX is perfectly capable of being a desktop publishing setup, multimedia hub or even server. SuperX uses a tweaked version of KDE as its Graphical User Interface for providing a more polished, smooth and beautiful looking desktop experience which is delightful to use. SuperX is based on the Linux kernel with Hardware Enablement (HWE) for use on newer hardware and follows the Ubuntu LTS specifications. As a consequence, it is strong, stable and recovers quickly.
