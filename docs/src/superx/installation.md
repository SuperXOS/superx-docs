# Installation

## Overview

The SuperX OS is made to make Linux computing more simple and easy for general users. It is easy to use, easy to install and includes everything you need to run your organisation, school, home or enterprise. It’s also open source, secure, accessible and free to download.

We also have an article on creating [a bootable usb](https://wiki.superxos.com/Create_bootable_USB_flash_drive) that explain how to create an SuperX DVD or USB flash drive.

## Boot from USB flash drive

Most computers will boot from USB automatically. Simply insert the USB flash drive and either power on your computer or restart it. You should see the same welcome window , prompting you to choose your language and either install or try the SuperX desktop.

If your computer doesn’t automatically boot from USB, try holding F12 when your computer first starts. With most machines, this will allow you to select  the USB device from a system-specific boot menu. 

F12 is the most common key for bringing up your system’s boot menu, but Escape, F2 and F10 are common alternatives. If you’re unsure, look for a brief message when your system starts - this will often inform you of which key to press to bring up the boot menu.

## Installation Wizard

### Install or try screen

Once the system is booted using the USB Or disk you can see the following screen presented before you with options including “Try SuperX” and “Install SuperX” as shown in the image below,
