User friendly: SuperX is user friendly, which means that it aims to as easy as possible for the user. The OS embraces beginners and casual users and makes them feel at home.

Powerful: Simplicity doesn't mean feature-less. SuperX is powerful and very handy for professionals and experts. The GNU utilities plus the software packages available is enough for SuperX to be used for any task. So SuperX is perfectly capable of being your desktop publishing setup, multimedia hub or even your server.

Energetic: SuperX uses a tweaked (modified) version of KDE as its GUI, providing a polished, pretty and buttery desktop which is a delight to use.

Robust: SuperX is based on the Linux kernel. As a consequence, it is strong, resilient to crashes and recovers quickly. Moreover, unlike Windows, it is virus and malware-free and no one can gain access to your computer without your knowledge. With SuperX installed, you need not defragment the hard-drive or clean up the registry every month, as all housekeeping is done by the OS itself.
