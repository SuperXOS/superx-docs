## Introduction

SuperX stands for "Simple, User friendly, Powerful, Energetic and Robust eXperience".

SuperX aims to be as simple and down-to-earth as possible avoiding bloat and unnecessary components. It aims to be as easy as possible for the non Linux users especially those who are coming from Microsoft Windows. The operating system embraces beginners, casual users and makes them feel at home. Simplicity doesn't mean feature-less. SuperX is as powerful and very handy for professionals and experts alike. The GNU utilities plus the software packages available are enough to be used for any task. SuperX is perfectly capable of being a desktop publishing setup, multimedia hub or even server. SuperX uses a tweaked version of KDE as its Graphical User Interface for providing a more polished, smooth and beautiful looking desktop experience which is delightful to use. SuperX is based on the Linux kernel with Hardware Enablement (HWE) for use on newer hardware and follows the Ubuntu LTS specifications. As a consequence, it is strong, stable and recovers quickly. It is virus and malware-free and no one can gain access to computer without knowledge. There is no need to defragment the hard-drive or clean up the registry every month, as all housekeeping is done by the operating system itself.

## Version history

Plasma version may be updated according to KDE's releases.


The first formal release, SuperX 1.0 "Galileo", was released to selected users on April 24, 2011 and was made available to the public as a free download on October 8, 2011. The second release, SuperX v1.1 "Cassini" was released on June 21, 2012. It is an LTS version with 5 years of support.

The latest version is 5.0 "Lamarr" which was released on May 02, 2019 based on Ubuntu 18.04 and KDE Neon code base. It features a highly modified KDE workspace. Version 5.0 updates in a much slower and predictable rate and thus Qt and KDE libraries maybe not be binary compatible with KDE Neon.

It comes with 4 years of security, maintenance and standard support of all the packages and will be supported until April 2023.

## Philosophy Behind

SuperX is not just an operating system, it is a technological representation of a philosophy. SuperX is a propagator of Free and open source Software. Most of the software made today focus on commercialization and not the users who actually uses it. It results the software vendor controls the user as they make license agreements that gives the software developer total control over their users.

When users don't control the software,[Installation Guide](https://wiki.superxos.com/Installation_Guide) the software controls the users. The developer who controls the software, through it controls the users. This is called “proprietary” software is therefore an instrument of unjust power. This means the developer is actually controlling the user. The user has no freedom.

Proprietary Software is an injustice to humanity, is our philosophy when it comes to proprietary software. Proprietary software might have back-doors that can steal private information of the user without the user even noticing it.This a form of digital colonization , and using such software makes the user a victim of it. The user is virtually a slave of the developer.Also some companies even restrict users to download and use only the applications from their online application store. This is like baby sitting he user.

Just consider an example: you are buying a car and the car vendor is telling that you can only refill gas (fuel) in their gas station (fueling station) and think the worst scenario even filling up flat tyres or anything you need to change in that car can only be done in their garage and those changes which are actually to be given free or of low cost are charged so high that nearly in a year the cost of upgrades and tweaks exceeds the cost of the car itself.

### Free/Libre Open-Source Software

As per [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org/), “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that **the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software**. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis.

## How to get started

SuperX comes in the form of an ISO image (an .iso file) which can be used to make a bootable DVD or a bootable USB stick.
